#Given a sequence of non-negative integers, where each number is written in a separate line. Determine the length of the sequence, where the sequence ends when the integer is equal to 0.
# Print the length of the sequence (not counting the integer 0). The numbers following the number 0 should be omitted.

count=0
while int(input())!=0:
        count+=1
