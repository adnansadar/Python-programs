#Given an integer n, create a two-dimensional array of size (n√ón) and populate it as follows, with spaces between each character:
	#The positions on the minor diagonal (from the upper right to the lower left corner) receive 1 .
    #The positions above this diagonal recieve 0 .
    #The positions below the diagonal receive 2 . 

Print the elements of the resulting array.
